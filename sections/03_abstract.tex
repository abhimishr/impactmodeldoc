The International Food Policy Research Institute's IMPACT model is a robust tool for analyzing global and regional challenges in food, agriculture, and natural resources. Continuously updated and refined since it was first developed in early 1990s, IMPACT version 4 is the latest update to the model for enhanced treatment of complex issues, including climate change, food security, and economic development. IMPACT 4 modeling system integrates climate, crop simulation, and water models into a comprehensive system, providing decision-makers with a flexible platform to assess the potential impacts of various scenarios on biophysical systems, socioeconomic trends, technologies, and policies.
