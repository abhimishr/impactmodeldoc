\subsection*{Funding}

This work was undertaken as part of the Foresight initiative of the CGIAR led by the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) and funded by \textcolor{red}{\textbf{donors A, B, C}}. 

\subsection*{Author contributions}

Abhijeet Mishra updated IMPACT v3.6 documentation based on IMAPCT v3 documentation based on \cite{robinson2015international}.

Shahnila Dunston, Abhijeet Mishra, Timothy B. Sulser and Yohannes Gebretsadik contributed to the coding of the IMPACT 3.6 model system components.

All authors contributed to the research design of IMPACT 3.6.

\subsection*{Additional acknowledgments}

All software development and complex modeling are ultimately built on the work of many researchers, colleagues, and outside experts over an extended period of time. We would thus like to acknowledge that IMPACT 3.6 was built on the extensive work done in the previous versions of the model. 

IMPACT has become increasingly used in work involving multidisciplinary researchers outside of IFPRI. We would like to thank helpful contributions in improving the model. We would like to thank the following colleagues who also provided valuable expertise and support. In particular, we would like to acknowledge the assistance and feedback from several key individuals:
