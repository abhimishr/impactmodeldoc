\subsection*{Additional acknowledgments}

All software development and complex modeling are ultimately founded on the contributions of numerous researchers, colleagues, and external experts over a prolonged period. We acknowledge that IMPACT 3.6 was built upon the extensive work carried out in previous versions of the model.

IMPACT has seen growing usage among multidisciplinary researchers beyond IFPRI. We extend our gratitude to those who have contributed to the model's improvement, including many of our colleagues at IFPRI for their valuable expertise and support. We also acknowledge the assistance and feedback from several key individuals:
