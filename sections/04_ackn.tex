\textbf{\textcolor{red}{TBD: include contributions by individuals who helped develop earlier versions of the model}}
%We acknowledge that IMPACT 4.1 was built upon the extensive work carried out in previous versions of the model. IMPACT has seen growing usage among multidisciplinary researchers beyond IFPRI. We extend our gratitude to those who have contributed to the model's improvement, including many of our colleagues at IFPRI for their valuable expertise and support. We also acknowledge the assistance and feedback from Claudia Ringler and Nicostratos Perez. 

%We would also like to especially thank Athanasios Petsakos (Alliance of Bioversity International and the International Center for Tropical Agriculture) for helpful suggestions and comments while reviewing this documentation.
