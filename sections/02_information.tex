{\small
Established in 1975, the International Food Policy Research Institute (IFPRI) offers evidence-based policy solutions aimed at ending hunger and malnutrition while reducing poverty sustainably. The Institute engages in comprehensive research, disseminates findings, fosters partnerships, and builds capacity to promote sustainable food production, healthy food systems, improved markets and trade, agricultural transformation, resilience building, and strengthened institutions and governance. Gender considerations are integrated into all of IFPRI’s initiatives. IFPRI collaborates globally with development implementers, public institutions, the private sector, and farmers’ organizations to ensure that food policies at local, national, regional, and global levels are grounded in evidence. IFPRI is a member of the CGIAR Consortium.
